## About me

Since 2016, I have been working in web development, utilizing a variety of technologies in both design and frontend and backend development. This experience has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the challenges in web development. Additionally, I have experience working in teams that implement Agile methodologies, quickly adapting and collaborating effectively in dynamic environments.


My constant motivation is to stay updated with the latest trends and advancements in web development. Therefore, since 2022, I have been dedicating time to specialized training in Front End development, completing two bootcamps with Vue.js at Eurecat and La Salle Universidad Ramon Llull, and one focused on Angular at IT Academy de Barcelona Activa. For the final project of the Angular bootcamp, I designed and developed an application for room rentals by geolocation, incorporating advanced features such as user authentication with password encryption and session management with JWT. I used technologies like Angular, Nest, MySQL, Mapbox, and TailwindCSS. You can see the demonstration of this project [here](https://ezhub.vercel.app/).

Currently, I am actively collaborating on the ITA Challenges project at IT Academy as part of my internship, an application for completing programming challenges. My role includes implementing new interactive features, performing unit testing with Jest, and collaborating in task management using GitHub. You can explore the code [here](https://github.com/IT-Academy-BCN/ita-challenges-frontend). Additionally, I continue to add new features to my personal project, EZHub.

I consider myself an autonomous, flexible person with meticulous attention to detail. I enjoy working in a team, exchanging ideas, and cooperating to achieve objectives.
