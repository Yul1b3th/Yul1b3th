## About me

Since 2016, I have worked in web development, using various technologies across design, frontend, and backend. I also have experience working in teams that implement Agile methodologies. Since 2022, I have specialized in frontend development, completing a bootcamp in Angular at IT Academy and others in Vue.js at La Salle Universidad Ramon Llull and Eurecat. For my final project in Angular, I developed an application for room search by geolocation, integrating advanced features such as user authentication, password encryption, and session management with JWT, using Angular, Nest, MySQL, Mapbox, and TailwindCSS. You can see the demonstration of this project [here](https://ezhub.vercel.app/).

As a Front End Developer with Angular at IT Academy, I collaborated on the ITA Challenges project, a programming challenge application, where I implemented new interactive features, unit tests with Jest, and managed tasks on GitHub. You can explore the code [here](https://github.com/IT-Academy-BCN/ita-challenges-frontend).

I am autonomous, flexible, and detail-oriented. I enjoy teamwork and collaborating to achieve common goals. I am open to new collaborations and opportunities for growth in web development.

- [ITA Challenges Frontend](https://github.com/IT-Academy-BCN/ita-challenges-frontend)
- [ITA Challenges Backend](https://github.com/IT-Academy-BCN/ita-challenges-backend)

### üõ†Ô∏è EZHub
An application in development for room searches by geolocation, designed as the final project for my Angular bootcamp at IT Academy. The application interacts with the backend to manage users, properties, and rooms, and includes user authentication with JWT and password encryption. Built with Angular, Nest, MySQL, Mapbox, and TailwindCSS.

### ‚úÖ EduMap
An application that allows users to visualize and analyze data related to access and equity in education through interactive maps. Data sourced from OpenData Barcelona allows users to explore indicators by district, such as household income and distribution of educational centers. This project was part of a hackathon at IT Academy, held on October 22, 2024, and involved a team of professionals in Data Analysis, Back-End, and Front-End disciplines.
